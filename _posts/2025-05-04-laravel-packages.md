Working with Laravel is awesome, especially when using packages that help you quickly finish your projects while following all SOTA best practices and recommendations. Below are some Laravel packages that I find helpful for accomplishing my projects:

* [spatie/laravel-permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission) - for handling roles and permissions.
* [spatie/laravel-sluggable](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-sluggable) - for automatically generate URL-friendly slugs.
* [spatie/laravel-tags](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-tags) - add tags and taggable behaviour.
* [spatie/eloquent-sortable](https://github.com/spatie/eloquent-sortable) - adds sortable behaviour to an Eloquent model.
* [Laravel Debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) - for debugging and profiling.

I kept this wonderful package that helps you create your admin panel quickly and easily; it's called [Filament](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament).

There others such as: [Orchid](https://orchid.software/en/), [Backpack](https://backpackforlaravel.com/).

If you decide to use Filament, as I did, you can add these additional related plugins to enhance your admin panel:

* [filament shield](https://github.com/bezhanSalleh/filament-shield)
* [spatie-laravel-media-library-plugin](https://github.com/filamentphp/spatie-laravel-media-library-plugin)
* [filament-spatie-tags](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/filament-spatie-tags) (used with spatie/laravel-tags)
